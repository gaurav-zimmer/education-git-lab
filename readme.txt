Git is very useful in education.
It can be used to share the notes and keep track of updates in the notes.
Branches can be created for students to upload their project work.
This is also very useful when doing collaborative projects.

Version control importance:
Version control is important because it tracks the changes made to the files and if required, old versions can be retrieved.
